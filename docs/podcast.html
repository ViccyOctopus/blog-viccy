      <h2>quantum theory for the ears: a podcast</h2>
      <p>i remember taking physics in highschool sophomore year. it was pretty difficult, mostly 
        because i had a horrible teacher. i ended up getting a B in the class, my first and last B
        in highschool. 
        <br><br>
        but, after watching a ted talk, i was inspired to learn more about the idea of quantum entanglement.
        spotaneously, i bought a book by the MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series on quantum entanglement and read
        it feverishly. now, here i am, inspired and with my own podcast.
        <br><br>
        new episodes come out on average every 2-3 weeks :)
