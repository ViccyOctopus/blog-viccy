      feeding south florida is an organization i've been volunteering with since summer of my junior year.
      it takes in volunteers and you inspect, sort, and build boxes for families and places that need them.
      many churches and soup kitchens buy these huge bulks.
      <br><br>
      after volunteering with them for over 100 hours, i was admitted into the ambassadors program for feeding
      south florida. i decided to then advocate for the organization and how hold over 200 hours.
      <br><br>
      later, i ended up founding the first-ever at wolfson SAS Feeding South Florida club, where i educate people
      the importance of preventing food insecurity and how to make budget, healthy meals. soon ill host food drives,
      and ill post about how that goes.
      <br><br>
      here, you can find my many treasured memories with the food bank.
