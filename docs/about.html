          hello! my name is victoria arzumanova.
          <br><br>
          i am a high school student that goes to school for advanced studies at wolfson. i believe,
          as i am writing this, that we are ranked 4th in the nation. thats really crazy to me, honestly.
          <br><br>
          ever since i was small, i have always been interested in computers.
          <br><br>
          granted, it was video games when i was a wee child, but they were computers okay.
          i loved computers. heck though, i didnt know anything about them.
          <br><br>
          yet though, as long as you have the drive and motivation, you can do anything.
          thats sort of how i became president of coding club and a html-css-java-c-c++-python-knower.
          im making my own website right now! what a thought.
          <br><br>
          but, even though i am, i have no idea how i want the design to look. ill figure it out in due time
          (wow, i just got deja vu!). 
          <br><br><br><br><br>
          tldr; check out my website! its a storage for my projects.
